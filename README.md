# Life Checklist App
This is a simple and small React Application called "Life Checklist". 

It was written using Functional Components, hooks like useState() and useEffect() and Styled Components
for styling.

You are given 35 things. You can click on one of them (or the checkbox) to highlight. It would mean that you've done this in your amazing life.

At the bottom of the page there will be a conlusion which says how many things have been done by you.
